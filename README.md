<br>
I'm interested in computer graphics and game making. <br>
I don't know much yet, and I'm a beginner, so I'm looking for someone to study hard with. <br>
I want to help each other and grow together. <br>
Then, I want to work on a project to create a simple 3D game using DirectX11. <br>
<br>
If you are interested, please contact me via my email.
